# Context Bridge — Phase 22.1 (local, coctl-based)

> Status: shipped (Linux + macOS). Original SSH-flavored OSC design preserved in [§ Out of scope but designed for revival](#out-of-scope-but-designed-for-revival).

## Purpose

The [Phase 22 dossier panel](./roadmap.md#phase-22-context-aware-workstation-hub) needs to know the active pane's repo / branch / cwd / tmux session in real time. The shell already has that information — it's the only thing in the system that does, reliably, on every prompt. The bridge is just plumbing to get it from the shell to copad's bus.

## Mechanism — `coctl event publish` from precmd

Each prompt redraw, the shell's precmd hook constructs a `pane.context_changed` payload and publishes it via `coctl event publish pane.context_changed '<json>'`:

```
shell precmd ─►  coctl event publish  ─►  copadd events.publish  ─►  EventBus
                                                                       │
                                              ┌────────────────────────┘
                                              ▼
                                    GUI ContextService + GUI → daemon forwarder
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                    daemon ContextService + ring buffer + triggers
```

The shell is a direct child of copad (via VTE / SwiftTerm), so it inherits `$COPAD_SOCKET` and `$COPAD_PANEL_ID`. The first is a "this is a copad-spawned shell" marker for the hook to gate emission on; the second is the per-pane id the hook stamps onto every payload so `ContextService` can key its per-panel cache correctly.

(Implementation note: `coctl event publish` dials the daemon socket at `daemon_socket_path()` directly — it doesn't actually *use* `$COPAD_SOCKET` as the transport. The env var is presence-only. This means **daemon availability is a hard prerequisite** — if `copadd` is down, the hook silently no-ops and `pane_context` stays stale until the next prompt.)

## Wire format — `PaneContext`

The payload is a flat JSON object matching [`copad_core::context::PaneContext`](../copad-core/src/context.rs):

```json
{
  "panel_id": "8a1c…uuid",
  "host":     "arch",
  "cwd":      "/home/marshall/dev/copad",
  "git_remote": "marshallku/copad",
  "branch":   "master",
  "tmux_session": "",
  "pane_cmd": "zsh",
  "timestamp_ms": 1748419200000,
  "v": 1
}
```

Every string field is `String` (not `Option<String>`) — missing or undeterminable values are empty strings `""`, not `null`. `timestamp_ms` is an `i64` (zsh `$EPOCHSECONDS * 1000`; second precision is enough for per-prompt rate). `v` is a schema version; older / newer payloads round-trip cleanly because the deserializer uses `#[serde(default)]` per field — extra fields are ignored, missing fields default to empty.

`panel_id` is the only required field: events with an empty `panel_id` are dropped by `ContextService::apply_event` (debug-logged, no panic).

## Trust boundary

`coctl event publish` reaches the daemon over the Unix socket, which carries `SO_PEERCRED` source stamping ([decision #23](./decisions.md)). The daemon marks the resulting event `Origin::External` ([decision #37](./decisions.md)). That gating model is the entire application-layer security model — there is no HMAC, no per-session secret, no state machine.

Consequence: **any same-UID process on the workstation can publish `pane.context_changed` with an arbitrary `panel_id`.** The dossier panel (Phase 22.2) and any other consumer should treat `pane_context` as best-effort display data, not authoritative state. When trigger conditions eventually interpolate `pane_context.*` fields (a future engine extension — not enforceable in the current TriggerEngine), each consuming trigger must opt in via `[triggers.security] accept_external = true`, the existing harness pattern.

This trust model holds because the threat model is "single user on their own workstation." If that ever needs to expand (e.g., multi-user systems, remote shells over SSH), the [revival design](#out-of-scope-but-designed-for-revival) below is what to bring back.

## Why not OSC for the local case

Bytes-through-PTY only buys anything when copad and the shell aren't already in the same trust domain — i.e., remote SSH where the shell can't reach copad's socket. For a copad-spawned local shell, the socket *is* available, IPC is microseconds, and OSC parsing requires custom VTE bindings or an FFI shim that's not exposed in the `vte4` 0.8.x Rust API today. The coctl path is strictly simpler.

## macOS parity

The macOS shell-spawn already injects both `$COPAD_SOCKET` and `$COPAD_PANEL_ID` — both backends do it: SwiftTerm legacy via `copad-macos/Sources/Copad/TerminalViewController.swift:527-528`, alacritty via `copad_term_create` in `copad-term/src/lib.rs:346-358` (called from `AlacrittyTerminalViewController`). The shell hook is the same script Linux uses — `examples/shell/copad-context.zsh` is shipped to `~/.config/copad/shell-hooks/copad-context.zsh` by `scripts/install-macos.sh`, no platform fork. One gotcha to keep in mind if the script is ever rewritten:

**Timestamp**: zsh's `$EPOCHSECONDS` (from `zmodload zsh/datetime`) works on both platforms (zsh ≥ 5.0 ships on modern macOS). `$EPOCHREALTIME` is a float and would fail `i64` deserialization. `date +%s%N` is GNU-only — don't use it. If a future macOS port targets older zsh, fall back to `python3 -c 'import time;print(int(time.time()*1000))'`.

Swift-side wiring (mirror of Linux's `copad-linux/src/window.rs` + `gui_client.rs` Phase 22.1 changes):

- `copad-macos/Sources/CopadCore/ContextService.swift` — Swift mirror of `copad_core::context::ContextService`. `apply(eventKind: "pane.context_changed", data:)` parses the payload via the `PaneContext` struct (same struct shape as `copad_core::context::PaneContext` with `#[serde(default)]` semantics) and stores it keyed by `panel_id`. `snapshot()` derives `pane_context` from the active panel only, matching Rust's `Context::pane_context` derivation. `panel.exited` cleans up both cwd and pane_context entries. Empty `panel_id` and non-dict payloads are silently dropped, same as Linux.
- `copad-macos/Sources/Copad/DaemonClient.swift` — `"pane.context_changed"` added to `forwardKinds` so any GUI-side emitter (plugin, future trigger) is forwarded to the daemon. The normal path is coctl publishing directly to the daemon socket (no GUI traversal), but the allowlist is the contract for *any* GUI-side emitter — keeps Linux/macOS forward-list symmetric.
- `copad-macos/Tests/CopadCoreTests/ContextServiceTests.swift` — XCTest cases mirroring `copad-core/src/context.rs` `pane_context_*` tests. Pure-logic test surface; runs under `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift test` (Command Line Tools alone do not ship XCTest).

## Per-shell init

The canonical zsh implementation ships at [`examples/shell/copad-context.zsh`](../examples/shell/copad-context.zsh). Three properties that matter:

1. **Silent no-op outside copad shells**: the `[[ -n "$COPAD_PANEL_ID" && -n "$COPAD_SOCKET" ]] && command -v coctl >/dev/null 2>&1` guard makes the script safe to `source` from a global `.zshrc`.
2. **Never blocks the prompt**: *all* data gathering (git remote / branch / tmux query / hostname) runs inside the detached `( ... &!) 2>/dev/null` subshell. Synchronous git calls on slow mounts or unresponsive tmux servers won't reach the prompt.
3. **JSON escaping is lossy for rare control bytes**: backslash / `"` / `\b\f\n\r\t` are escaped. Other control bytes (0x01-0x1f outside this set) would need `\uXXXX` form; instead the daemon rejects with a parse error and the hook silently skips that one prompt's emission. Acceptable — those characters are vanishingly rare in real paths.

**bash and fish** are mechanical follow-ups: same payload, same `coctl` call, different precmd hook surface (`PROMPT_COMMAND` for bash, `fish_prompt` for fish). Not in the v1 ship.

## Open questions

- **`pane_cmd` refinement** — the shell can only report its own name (`$ZSH_NAME` = `"zsh"`). The actual foreground command during execution is something copad already tracks via VTE. If the dossier panel ever wants live `pane_cmd` during long-running commands, copad can override the shell-reported value with its own — but only at panel-render time, not in the published event (the event timing is precmd, which is between commands).
- **Trigger interpolation over `pane_context.*`** — the current TriggerEngine exposes `context.active_panel` / `context.active_cwd` / `context.presence` only. Surfacing `pane_context.git_remote` etc. is a future engine extension. When it lands, the load-bearing security note is: `accept_external` alone gates only the firing event's origin; if a same-UID-spoofed `pane.context_changed` poisons `ContextService` and a *later, internal* event interpolates the poisoned state, `accept_external` won't have caught it. The future extension must enforce origin-aware reads of context fields, not just origin-aware firing.

## Out of scope but designed for revival

The original Phase 22 design covered SSH and tmux-across-hosts. That path needs OSC bytes traveling through the PTY (the only signal that survives `ssh` and tmux pass-through unchanged), plus crypto to gate "emitted at prompt time vs mid-output execution." It was dropped because the implementation cost — VTE OSC capture (Rust bindings don't expose a custom-OSC API today), HMAC plumbing, OSC 133 prompt-boundary state machine, per-session secret distribution over `SSH SendEnv` — outweighed the value for the current user. If SSH coverage returns, this is the shape to bring back:

### Wire format

Custom `OSC <N> ; v1 ; <json> ST` where `<N>` is picked from a shortlist of three candidates: `OSC 6500` (custom high-range, no collisions, recommended), `OSC 1337` (iTerm2 conv with a `copad-context=<base64>` key), or `OSC 133 ; P` extension. JSON payload identical to the current `PaneContext` plus a top-level `hmac` field.

### Trust boundary

OSC bytes are part of the PTY byte stream, so `cat malicious_file.txt` could otherwise inject a fake context. Three layers, applied together:

1. **OSC 133 prompt-boundary state machine** (primary): per-pane state initialized `idle`; `OSC 133 ; A`/`P` → `at-prompt`; `OSC 133 ; B`/`C` → `idle`. OSC 6500 honored only in `at-prompt`. Shell init emits OSC 133 alongside the context payload from the same precmd hook so the marks are state-machine-ordered.
2. **HMAC-SHA256** (defense-in-depth): per-session secret `$COPAD_CONTEXT_SECRET` injected on shell spawn. Catches malicious data files that emit OSC bytes without access to the secret. Does NOT replace mitigation 1, because env-var inheritance allows child processes to compute valid MACs from mid-output.
3. **Timestamp window** (replay protection): reject payloads more than 5 minutes off the local clock.

Opt-outs (`require_prompt_boundary = false`, `require_hmac = false`) are documented as security-relaxing; both off is a startup warning.

### copad-side wiring

Linux: custom OSC dispatcher via VTE FFI (the Rust bindings don't expose this today — would need a shim crate). macOS: `alacritty_terminal`'s OSC stream match arm (already exposed in `copad-term`).

### Secret distribution over SSH

For HMAC validation on payloads emitted from an SSH session, `$COPAD_CONTEXT_SECRET` must reach the remote shell. Use `SendEnv COPAD_CONTEXT_SECRET` in `~/.ssh/config` + matching `AcceptEnv` in remote `sshd_config` for trusted hosts. Documented opt-out (`require_hmac = false`) for untrusted hosts.

### Why all of this is on the bench

Three things would have to change to justify implementing the above:
- The user actually wants to SSH into a remote box and have copad's dossier panel reflect that remote shell's context.
- VTE 0.8.x (or successor) exposes a custom-OSC subscribe API, OR we're willing to write a FFI shim crate.
- The trust model expands beyond "single user on their own workstation."

None of these are true today. The design lives here so it's not lost.
